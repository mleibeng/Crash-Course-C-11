C++11 Crash Course: Webserver Edition
1. Refresher on Templates and Containers

Template improvements

Variadic templates
Template aliases (using keyword)

Container enhancements

Unordered containers (unordered_map, unordered_set)
Array container
Forward_list

2. New Interesting Features

Auto keyword for type inference
Range-based for loops
Lambda expressions
nullptr keyword
Strongly-typed enumerations (enum class)
Move semantics and rvalue references
Smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr)
Initializer lists
Delegating constructors
Override and final specifiers

3. Useful Libraries

Chrono library for time-related operations
Thread support library
Regular expressions (regex)
Random number generation
Tuple library
Type traits
Atomic operations

4. C++11 Features for Webserver Development

Lambda expressions for callback functions
Smart pointers for resource management
Multithreading for handling concurrent connections
Chrono for timeouts and benchmarking
Regex for URL parsing and request validation

5. Nginx-specific Considerations

Event-driven architecture
Asynchronous I/O
Connection pooling
Reverse proxy and load balancing

6. Practical Examples

Implementing a simple HTTP server
Parsing HTTP requests using regex
Managing client connections with smart pointers
Using chrono for request timing
Implementing a thread pool for request handling

7. Best Practices and Performance Considerations

RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
Move semantics for efficient data handling
Lock-free programming with atomics
Proper use of const and constexpr

8. C++11 in Modern Web Development

Comparison with other languages/frameworks
Integration with existing C/C++ libraries
Potential performance benefits

9. Future Directions

Brief overview of C++14, C++17, and C++20 relevant features
Ongoing evolution of C++ in server-side development
